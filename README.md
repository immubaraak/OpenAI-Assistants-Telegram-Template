# OpenAI Assistants API Template For Telegram

**To build out profitable Telegram Bots with this template, please contact [@AutoNate](https://t.me/@AutoNate).**

You will learn how to read various markets to quickly discover their patterns, stressors and relaxers. Then you will use ChatGPT to configure a plan that innovates their patterns. We will then automate this plan and deliver it via a Telegram bot. This approach will not only make you filthy rich, but also helps the people in those markets! 

This template serves as your frontend and backend for those automations!

With Telegram having over 1 billion active users a month, you are essentially bringing the power of AI and automations to the everyday person. You're doing this by learning how to build innovative solutions to their current patterns, and then by easily delivering the solution via the trusted Telegram platform.

Let's get a bag ðŸ˜Ž

Hit me up!

## Project Overview

**THE** Telegram bot template youâ€™ve been looking for. One template, infinite possibilities. 

Powered by Python and OpenAI, this setup isnâ€™t just about building botsâ€”itâ€™s about creating experiences. 

Need a bot to solve niche problems? Automate tasks? This templateâ€™s got your back. 

The architecture is flexible, scalable, and ready to monetize.

Weâ€™ve handled the heavy liftingâ€”AI functions, modular design, easy extensions. 

All you need is creativity!

Plug in your ideas, tweak the code, and let the bot do the rest.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repo -> `git clone https://github.com/telegram-bot-builders/OpenAI-Assistants-Telegram-Template.git tele-bot`
2. cd into the newly created directory -> `cd tele-bot`
3. create new venv -> `python -m venv env` or `python3 -m venv env`
4. initiate venv -> Unix: `source env/bin/activate` Windows: `env\Scripts\activate`
5. install requirements with -> `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. create .env file -> `touch .env`
7. update following values in the .env file
   - OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxx
   - TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=xxxxxx
   - ASSISTANT_ID=xxxxx 

## How To Extend The Code

Now that you've got the basics down, itâ€™s time to level up by extending the botâ€™s functionality. Whether you're looking to add new command handlers, integrate advanced AI features, or introduce entirely new modules, this template is designed for easy expansion. Here's how you can get started:

#### 1. **Adding New Command Handlers in `bot.py`**

When you want your bot to handle more commands, like `/stats` or `/feedback`, youâ€™ll need to create new handlers in `bot.py`. 

**Example:**
- Add a new command handler by defining a function and registering it in the `setup_handlers()` method.

```python
async def stats(self, update: Update, context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE) -> None:
    # Example of what you could do here: fetch and send user stats
    stats_message = "Here are your stats..."
    await update.message.reply_text(stats_message)

def setup_handlers(self):
    self.application.add_handler(CommandHandler('start', self.start))
    self.application.add_handler(CommandHandler('help', self.help))
    self.application.add_handler(CommandHandler('engage', self.engage))
    self.application.add_handler(CommandHandler('stats', self.stats))  # New command handler added
    self.application.add_handler(MessageHandler(filters.TEXT & ~filters.COMMAND, self.handle_text))
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Adding new commands allows you to respond to specific user needs or provide additional functionality like gathering feedback, showing statistics, or anything else your niche might require.

#### 2. **Extending AI Features in `ai.py`**

The `ai.py` file is your go-to for all things AI-related. If you've identified specific patterns or problems in your market, this is where you implement solutions that leverage AI.

**Example:**
- You could create a new AI function that provides personalized recommendations based on user input.

```python
def generate_recommendations(thread_id, user_input):
    # Imagine this function uses OpenAI to provide personalized recommendations
    response = client.beta.threads.messages.create(
        thread_id,
        role="assistant",
        content=f"Based on what you told me, here's what I'd recommend: {user_input}"
    )
    return response.content
```

- Then, in `bot.py`, connect this new function to a handler.

```python
async def recommend(self, update: Update, context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE) -> None:
    user_input = update.message.text
    recommendation = generate_recommendations(self.current_thread_id, user_input)
    await update.message.reply_text(recommendation)

def setup_handlers(self):
    self.application.add_handler(CommandHandler('recommend', self.recommend))  # Handler for recommendations
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Extending AI functionality allows you to deliver more sophisticated, context-aware responses that can address specific user needs in creative ways.

#### 3. **Adding New Modules and Connecting Them**

Want to add a completely new feature that doesnâ€™t quite fit into `bot.py` or `ai.py`? No problemâ€”just create a new module. After creating it, import the functionality into `bot.py` and link it up.

**Example:**
- Suppose you create a new file `analytics.py` that handles all data analytics for your bot. 

```python
# analytics.py
def analyze_user_data(user_id):
    # Your custom analytics logic here
    return f"Analytics for user {user_id}: ..."
```

- You can then import this function into `bot.py` and add it to a handler.

```python
from analytics import analyze_user_data

async def show_analytics(self, update: Update, context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE) -> None:
    user_id = update.message.from_user.id
    analytics_data = analyze_user_data(user_id)
    await update.message.reply_text(analytics_data)

def setup_handlers(self):
    self.application.add_handler(CommandHandler('analytics', self.show_analytics))  # New analytics handler
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Adding new modules lets you keep the codebase organized and modular, making it easier to maintain and scale. Whether you're integrating external APIs, adding new data processing layers, or implementing custom user interaction features, this approach keeps everything clean and manageable.
