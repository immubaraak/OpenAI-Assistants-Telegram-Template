# OpenAI Assistants API Template For Telegram

**To build out profitable Telegram Bots with this template, please contact [@AutoNate](https://t.me/@AutoNate).**

You will learn how to read various markets to quickly discover their patterns, stressors and relaxers. Then you will use ChatGPT to configure a plan that innovates their patterns. We will then automate this plan and deliver it via a Telegram bot. This approach will not only make you filthy rich, but also helps the people in those markets! 

This template serves as your frontend and backend for those automations!

With Telegram having over 1 billion active users a month, you are essentially bringing the power of AI and automations to the everyday person. You're doing this by learning how to build innovative solutions to their current patterns, and then by easily delivering the solution via the trusted Telegram platform.
